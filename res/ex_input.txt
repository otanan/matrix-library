//2 forward slashes denotes a comment

//Define matrices by putting the command "matrix"
//followed by a label to reference the matrix from
//The line after defines the dimensions of the matrix
//Finally, define the entries
matrix A
2 2
1 0
0 1

matrix B
2 2
42 -3
-1.2 12

//We can multiply A and B, the result is stored by
//concatenating the labels, in this case the product is called AB
multiply A B

//We can also store larger matrices
matrix C

//We can calculate determinants simply by calling det
//followed by the label of the matrix separated by a space
det AB

//Tranposing matrices is easy too
transpose AB
//The result is stored as AB^T
det AB^T
