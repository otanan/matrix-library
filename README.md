# Matrix Library

An exercise in programming basic matrix functionality in C. This little project tries to implement basic functions and operations from linear algebra to be easily usable and incorporated in C. There is some faux-OOP incorporated to make Matrix and Vector structs as intuitive as possible. There is a lot of room for improvement since major considerations (see: floating point operations and precision, optimization of operations and memory management, error handling, algorithms, general to-do) have been omitted in order to get as much exercise with the language as possible. Since this is also one of my first in-depth programming projects, the code is heavily commented but poorly documented.


## Getting Started

A shrewd makefile has been incorporated and object files removed. Simply compile the program and run it directly from "main.c" as an entry. Commands can be input there, and while basic file-reading functionality hasn't been finalized, it's a feature I hope to incorporate to simplify interfacing with the program and using it as a basic calculator.
